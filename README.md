# Alien Killer

## Computer game in which you have to shoot all invaders to win. You can choose the mode that you would like to play. There are new features such as: random movement of invaders, shooting and destroying, which energizes our reflexes, in a fun way. A mobile version could be made available!


###### To create this game, I used JavaScript and styled it with SASS. I created Alien Killer, to modernize a classic version of a previous game. This version has been produced for desktop computers, which could be transformed to suit other platforms. There are three levels of difficulty, and with some changes I could expand the game to create more difficult challenges. There are three buttons to control the game, however, to make it more interesting, I could include extra buttons to make the game more creative and dynamic.
